# Alpaca-Autotrader-Simple-moving-average

## Overview
This algorithmic trading program uses Simple Moving Average(SMA) as a trading indicator to buy and sell stock.
The program takes in real time stock data from the Alpaca brokerage API and determines 
if the currect price is a good time to buy or sell using SMA and excutes the trade without the need for human intervention.

## Data

The data file for this project which contains data on all 500 companies within the SP500.csv file is too big to upload
